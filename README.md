## Source files

`pigs-nose.tidal` is the sole source file for this EP, which will be maintained long term for compatibility with future notess of Tidal. This was originally written for Tidal 0.4 and has been patched for 0.7 (and to use `cps` instead of the original `bps` to define cycle length).

This includes the full composition of Pig's Nose EP as recorded, reformulated long after the fact because my original notes were awful. (I have preserved them on the `original-notes` tag for posterity.) I have also made various patches to use new syntax and to improve conciseness and reusability for future live performances.

## Sample attributions

```

All of the above samples from [Dirt-Samples](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Dirt-Samples/tree/c2db9a0dc4ffb911febc613cdb9726cae5175223).

```
qlatibro qspace
```

These are, respectively, derived from `latibro` and `space` from Dirt-Samples. Exactly the same actually, just with gain adjusted down a bit. (This was before `gain` was a synth parameter in Tidal. The good old days!)
